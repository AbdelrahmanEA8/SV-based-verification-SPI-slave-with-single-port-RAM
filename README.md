### Plan Overview
This section provides a high-level summary of the verification project. The primary goal is to ensure the functional correctness and protocol compliance of the SPI Slave DUT, which uses an internal asynchronous RAM. This interactive plan outlines the strategy, environment, and specific tests required to achieve comprehensive verification.
### Key Features to Verify
1.  SPI slave protocol compliance (Mode 0).
2.  Correct handling of read/write commands.
3.  Data integrity for all RAM operations.
4.  Correct behavior of control signals.
5.  Proper handling of asynchronous reset.
### DUT Interface Signals
| Signal     | Direction | Width | Description                      |
|------------|-----------|-------|----------------------------------|
| MOSI       | Input     | 1     | Master Out Slave In              |
| tx_valid   | Input     | 1     | Valid signal for input data      |
| tx_data    | Input     | 8     | 8-bit SPI input data             |
| rst_n      | Input     | 1     | Active-low asynchronous reset    |
| MISO       | Output    | 1     | Master In Slave Out              |
| rx_valid   | Output    | 1     | Output valid signal              |
| rx_data    | Output    | 10    | 10-bit SPI output data           |
## üèóÔ∏è Environment
### Verification Environment (VE)
This section details the UVM-based verification environment built to test the DUT. The diagram below illustrates the key components and their connections. This architecture enables a constrained-random, coverage-driven approach, ensuring robust and thorough testing. Click on a component's description to highlight it in the diagram.



## üß™ Test Plan
This section lists the specific test cases designed to verify the DUT. The chart below provides a visual breakdown of tests by priority, allowing for a quick assessment of the verification effort. You can click on a priority in the chart or use the filters to focus on specific test categories in the table.
## üéØ Verification Goals
This section defines the success criteria for the project. Verification is considered complete when all functional coverage points are met and all assertions pass consistently across the regression tests. These goals ensure that all specified features have been thoroughly exercised.
### Functional Coverage Plan
#### Transaction Coverage
1. Cover `READ` and `WRITE` commands.
2. Cover entire RAM address range (corners & regions).
3. Cover key data patterns (all 0s, all 1s, walking, etc).
4. Cross command types with address ranges.
#### DUT State Coverage
1. Cover transitions between idle, read, and write states.
2. Cover back-to-back read and write operations.
### SystemVerilog Assertions (SVA)
#### Protocol Assertions
1. `MISO` must be high-Z when `cs_n` is high.
2. `MOSI` data must be stable on `sclk` active edge.
3. `cs_n` must remain low for the entire transaction.
#### Behavioral Assertions
1. `rx_valid` must assert after a read command.
2. `rx_valid` must be a single-cycle pulse.
3. `MISO` must not be driven during a write operation.
